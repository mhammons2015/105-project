			<h2> Keep your mind open to learning EVERYTHING</h2>
			<p> When you start your journey with Skillcrush, you will THINK you know what your niche will be. You will get stuck on one skill.</p>

			<p> Open your mind to learning new things in tech. Take this learning oppurtunity to obsorb everything that is offered because you might find a new nivhe that comes naturally to you. I would much rather have many skills for more oppurtunities than one.</p>

			<h2> Use Google</h2>
			<p> When you get stuck for a few minutes, don't let it turn into HOURS like I did. Be resourceful. There is an amazing tech community out there! </p>

			<h2> For the PARENTS! </h2>
			<p> Save your code constantly. You never know when a toddler will smack your keyboard and ruin everything you spent hours working on. </p>
